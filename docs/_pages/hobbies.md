# Hobbies 

I've heard and use a few different phrases for the love of hobbies: 
- Hobbyist (A person who performs a hobby, but I use it to mean someone who loves hobbies)
- Amateur (from French amateur "lover of," from Latin amatorem (nominative amator) "lover")
- Collector of hobbies

Hobbies for me are part of my love of learning. Calling something a hobby is in a way a humble way of saying this is not my main thing but that does not mean I love it any less. So many things peak my interest, excite me, move me to want to pull open a laptop, grab a paper and pencil, grab a chisel then do something. I hope the content here invites you to do the same. 


Projects: 

## [Velomobile](/velomobile)

I have a passion for cycling and a new found interest in aerodynamics. I love the fact that under my own power I can get from point a to point b, no fossil fuels, no emissions. I have been fascinated for a long time with these weird 3 wheeled concrete bobsleds, so I am in the process of building one. Check it out if you want to follow my progress or get inspired to build your own. My build would never have made it past the dreaming stage if it weren't for the tons of blogs out there that others in the velomobile community have created. 

## Wood Working

### Standing Desk

I wanted to learn how to work with wood, and my 3d printed, upcycled glass standing desk is a bit wobbly so I set out to build this. Needless to say, I have a long way to go on my journey of becoming a woodworker! While the results weren't exactly what I wanted (although the quality is quite close to what I expected from a first project) I enjoyed the work.
