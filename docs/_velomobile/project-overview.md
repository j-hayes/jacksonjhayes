I am building a velomobile. 

{% include gallery caption="Velomobile Pictures" %}

Motivation:
- I want one.
  - Commuting faster, going faster, zooooom with no vrooom. 
- They are the same kind of dorky cool I aspire to be.
- I like building things
- Buying one can get really expensive.

I have broken down the project into a few phases with target deadlines for myself:

For Version 1 I decided to go with a simple build method to get a working velomobile as quickly as possible but with the ability to upgrade it to a more streamlined shell afterwards (we'll see if my software developer agile/scrum ideas will work in real life). I am going to build a rib structure out of insulation foam (a method used by many in the velomobile community) and skin it with Coroplast (a different method used by other's usually without the foam ribs). Version two I plan to head form hobby foam into a more curvy aerodynamic shape. 

- Version 1
  - Research (Complete)
    - Pick a trike
    - Pick a build methodology 
  - Design Phase 1 (June 2020) (Complete)
    - Build a CAD model of the outer shell using the specs of the trike I am going to buy
  - Buy the recumbent trike (when I get a job and have some income again)
  - Design Phase 2 (August 2020)
    - Take detailed measurements of the trike and CAD model
    - Design structure that will hold the shell to the frame of the trike and any 3D printed parts that may need to be made. 
  - Build Phase 1 (September 2020 - January 2021)
    - Cut Foam Rib Structure 
    - Skin With Coroplast 
    - Decorate 
- Version 2 
  - Research
    - Buy some foam and test bending it around a rib structure to learn the way to do it for the full scale model 
  - Skin the velomobile.
